# Predicting the Flight Delays

## Description

1. Predicts Flight departure delay prediction is done with respect to the origin airport and the airlines
2. This real-world problem is being presented as a software application, which embeds machine learning algorithms
3. This application software utilizes different tools to interact with the user for user input and provide the user input to the algorithms for the prediction
4. Implemented five algorithms, Support vector machines, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest and Neural Networks 
5. Top 4 algorithms are Ridge Regression, Random Forest, Neural Net and SVM
6. The final results will show the departure delays for a particular airline from a particular airport
7. Neural Net has performed the best by predicting the mean delay as 7.23 minutes for AA airline from DFW
